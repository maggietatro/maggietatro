    <h3>2017</h3>
    <blockquote> Maggie was an integral part of our department at Michigan State
      University’s College of Human Medicine. She consistently went above
      and beyond her normal job duties, and was always willing to help her
      fellow coworkers and students. She produced work quickly and
      accurately, and designed documents that were adopted as best
      practices by other departments. She regularly strived to improve her
      professional skills and share her knowledge with others to benefit
      the team at large. - J. Katz

    <h3>2016</h3>
    <blockquote> Maggie made a once dysfunctional reporting system into a very
      streamlined and easy to follow process. With over 50 graduate
      students trying to make deadlines, change degree plans, fill out the
      endless forms required to graduate, Maggie was quickly able to step
      in and answer our questions and quell our concerns and anxieties. She
      had the difficult task of working with many professionals, professors,
      students, and staff who were all demanding of her time and often
      giving contradictory requests. Maggie’s calm, approachable attitude
      was a great asset to our department and she made our program easier
      and more enjoyable. I highly recommend Maggie and enjoyed working
      with her. - B. McRoberts

    <blockquote> As an international student at MSU, dealing with numerous
      administrative forms was very challenging. However, Maggie made it very easy
      and very convenient for me. I do admire her great personality. Her positive
      attitude and exceptional professionalism made her an excellent resource person
      for graduate students in the department when it came down to administrative
      issues. I cannot ask for a better person. I do not hesitate to recommend
      Maggie for any future career she might want to pursue. - M. La

    <blockquote> Ms. Maggie was such an important resource in our department.
      Consistently, she was enthusiastic about her work and would always provide
      timely and reliable information that students needed. Ms. Maggie always
      kept track of each student’s profile and prompted us whenever there was
      something we needed to do. As an international student, Ms. Maggie was
      particularly helpful to me because a number of things in the US education
      system were new to me - but Ms. Maggie always took time to explain things as
      clearly as possible. The level of professionalism demonstrated by Ms. Maggie
      was a clear indication that she knew what her work was about - assisting
      graduate students. I give Ms. Maggie my every recommendation. - E. Ansah

    <blockquote> I had the opportunity to meet Maggie in a study abroad program in
      Barbados. During those 4 months, I learned a lot about Maggie’s work ethic
      and personality. She is a burst of light and love, and will certainly make
      an impactful and positive addition to any company she works for. Maggie is
      dependable, detail oriented, and very personable. She is a connector and
      fearless adventurer that would thrive in a fast paced environment. - S. Jiron

    <h3>2015</h3>
    <blockquote> Maggie was an exceptional employee whose dedication, diligence,
      and professionalism helped transform our program into something truly
      special. Her performance as the Program Coordinator/Compliance Specialist
      for The Adult Skills Center (TASC) had immediate and beneficial impact on
      our day program and helped create opportunities for our agency as a whole.
      I can recommend Maggie as a highly skilled and capable person who will be
      an effervescent and positive addition to any workforce she is a part of. - C.

    <blockquote> Maggie is great at initiating things; she has so much steam-power
      behind her. I can think of several steps in my academic and professional life
      that I wouldn’t have even taken unless Maggie had galvanized me. She has the
      optimistic spirit and originality to think of great ideas, and the guts to
      act on them. Also, she’s supremely reliable and has excellent judgment.
      Any staff would be so, so lucky to have Maggie on their team. - J. Beals

    <h3>2013</h3>
    <blockquote> Maggie was an extraordinary student, wise beyond her years. Her
      decision to study abroad in Barbados (a highly overlooked destination at
      the time) is also a testament to her independence and ability to go beyond
      convention. She is highly intelligent, conscientious, and has exceptional
      people skills. I’m excited to see where life takes her. - A. Murga
